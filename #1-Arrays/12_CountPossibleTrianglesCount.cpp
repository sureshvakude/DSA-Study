/*

Given an unsorted array of positive integers, find the number of triangles 
that can be formed with three different array elements as three sides of 
triangles. For a triangle to be possible from 3 values, the sum of any of 
the two values (or sides) must be greater than the third value (or third side). 

Examples: 

Input: arr= {4, 6, 3, 7}
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three triangles 
possible {3, 4, 6}, {4, 6, 7} and {3, 6, 7}. 
Note that {3, 4, 7} is not a possible triangle.  

Input: arr= {10, 21, 22, 100, 101, 200, 300}.
Output: 6
Explanation: There can be 6 possible triangles:
{10, 21, 22}, {21, 100, 101}, {22, 100, 101}, 
{10, 100, 101}, {100, 101, 200} and {101, 200, 300}
