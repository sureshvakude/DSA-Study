/*

Given a sorted and rotated array arr[] of size N and a key, the task is to find the key in the array.
Note: Find the element in O(logN) time and assume that all the elements are distinct.

Example:  

Input  : arr[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3}, key = 3
Output : Found at index 8

Input  : arr[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3}, key = 30
Output : Not found

Input : arr[] = {30, 40, 50, 10, 20}, key = 10   
Output : Found at index 3
